Choose the way that data is divided into buckets. Options are: *Jenks, Equal Interval, Heads/Tails*, and *Quantile*.  See [GIS Data Classifications in Cartographica](http://blog.cartographica.com/blog/2010/8/16/gis-data-classifications-in-cartographica.html) for more information and data quantification.
| Jenks -  Increases the standard deviation between each group of data while decreasing the standard deviation within each group. In other words, it increases the similarity within a given group in conjunction with the differences from each of the other groups. The Jenks method shuffles data across each group until it detects an optimization.
| Equal interval - Calculates the range of your data, and divides the total, into equally-sized subranges for your desired number of groups.
| Heads/Tails - Creates a break-point at the mean of your data, removes all data below the break-point, and creates the next break-point from the data above the first break-point. It repeats the break process until either a single value is left above the break-point, or if it reaches the desired number of breaks.
|  Quantile - Creates each group with an equal number of discrete units. The discrete units are gathered from the distinct possible values of your data.
