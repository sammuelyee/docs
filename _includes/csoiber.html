<div style="font-size:12pt;color:pink;">Writer Note_csobier: Add Include file here? 
  This content is shared beween the cartodb-editor.md and the faqs.md. I have created a new html file in the CartoDB/docs/_includes folder "sharingmaps.html". It is a copy of the platform.html include file that I copied. I am still working on adding shared content.
