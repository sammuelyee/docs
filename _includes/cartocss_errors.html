Entering CartoCSS styling is simple. Most common errors are a caused by typos and missing formatting.  If you are using the [CartoCSS Editor](cartodb-editor.html#apply-cartocss-with-the-cartocss-editor), you are notified which line of code is invalid. You can also click the *undo* and *redo* arrow buttons after entering code changes in the CartoCSS Editor.

For best practices, always apply the following format when entering CartoCSS code and be mindful of any quotes, brackets, and end line semi-colons.
	
		{% highlight bash %}
	{
		CartoCSS property name: value;
		CartoCSS property name: value;
		CartoCSS property name: value;
		CartoCSS property name: value;
	}
	{% endhighlight %}
