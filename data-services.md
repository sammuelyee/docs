## Introduction

CartoDB provides a number of free and paid data and services available for use in the Editor and in your apps through the use of the Platform. 

### Free data library

The free data library contains public sets of pre-processed data ready to be used. Select your favorite dataset and get started with the Editor or use it to enrich your analyses by adding new layers to your maps.

### Free geocoding

Have you ever dragged and dropped a file without coordinates into CartoDB and seen it suddenly become a beautiful map full of orange dots or polygons? It's not magic, it's CartoDB's geocoder! CartoDB automatically geocodes your Cities, IP Addresses and Administrative Regions thanks to its ultimate geocoding opensource technology. Forget about longitudes and latitudes and enjoy mapping.

### Street address geocoding

CartoDB's built-in integration with Here's geocoder will allow you to geocode Street Addresses as easily as you geocode your Cities or IP Addresses with the free geocoder.  

### Twitter search

CartoDB's exclusive integration with Twitter will allow you to interactively create new tweet datasets. Filter by keyword, hashtag or mention, select a timeframe and get your set of geolocalized tweets with all the information needed to create an insightful map.
